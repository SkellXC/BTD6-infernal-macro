# BTD6-infernal-macro
A macro that automatically places towers that let it complete the infernal map on btd6. 
Once a round is completed it restarts and goes back to the map.
Only works on certain screen sizes so you'll have to adjust the locations of pixels.
Use this to find the coordinates of pixels on each screen (leave the rgb values as they are)
