# BTD6-infernal-macro
A macro that automatically places towers that let it complete the infernal map on btd6. <br />
Once a round is completed it restarts and goes back to the map.
Only works on certain screen sizes so you'll have to adjust the locations of pixels.<br />
Use this to find the coordinates of pixels on each screen (leave the rgb values as they are)<br />
